# reporting
A collection of objects and functions designed to work with Pandas, and make easier the process of pulling Doubleclick reports into Excel. Also helps combine Prisma media exports with Doubleclick reports, a common stumbling block for those who use Prisma.

api - module to download and modify DFA reports via the DFA API
tools - collection of functions built to work with pandas and the api. Makes the task of downloading, reading, and combining reports easier

Still a work in progress.
